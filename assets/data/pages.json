I currently study Computer Science in the University of Brasilia in Brazil. I love programming and I spend most of my time doing it. I have already made tons of small aplications for myself, but only recently I built up enough knowledge to develop commercial level Apps.</p><p>I really like the Objective-C language, and it is the language I currently know the most. I also know a lot of Java and much of C and PHP. I can write something in C#, VB.NET and Ruby. I have already used some other languages, but they already fell in the realms of oblivion inside my brain.</p><hr><h2>Experiments</h2><p>In my spare time I like to work on coding experiments. Some become fully-fledged apps, others die right away. Some others are just too simple to become a product. Some of the latter will be posted in the list below.</p><ul id=\"experiments\"><li><a href=\"/experiments/voyagers\">Voyagers Now</a> â€“ September 2013<br><p>In September 2013, NASA announced that the Voyager 1 probe, launched in 1977, has passed the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopause_(astronomy)\" target=\"_blank\">heliopause</a>. This event caused some commotion on the internet and I, being a space geek, decided to create a simple hot site displaying how far both voyagers are from us. I used, with the propper permission, a JS script found in the NASA JPL website. The result is a simple diagram displaying the relative distance of the Voyager probes &mdash; and the planets &mdash; from the Earth and the Sun.</p></li></ul><hr><p>If you wish to send me a message, please contact me clicking the button below.</p><p>Thank you for your visit and have a nice day!</p><p class=\"link\"><a href=\"/contact\">Contact Me</a></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div></article>"
